<p>You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can&#39;t take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever&#39;s gonna know who saved the entire city.</p>
<p>It means you&#39;re hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I&#39;ve cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.</p>
<p>There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itself!</p>
<p>Do I really look like a guy with a plan?</p>
<p>But a man who doesn&#39;t care about the world doesn&#39;t spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. And isn&#39;t so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding.</p>
<p>You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.</p>
