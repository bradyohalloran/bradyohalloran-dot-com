						#I like to make cool things with computers and occasionally talk about myself in the third-person.
						
						You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city.
						
						It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.
						
						There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itself!
						
						Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
						
						But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding.
						
						You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.

						#In that time I worked on dozens of projects for major international clients as a <div id='text-roller'></div>

						Over fifteen years I saw Amnesia grow from a small team of about a dozen, into what it is today as Razorfish Australia. Though I’ve been at ostensibly the same company over that period, my role has constantly changed as the projects got bigger, crazier and more ambitious.

						Though initially starting as a Senior Designer, I quickly moved into other roles including:					

						* Design
						* Motion-design
						* Video editing
						* 3D modeling
						* Front-end development
						* Back-end development
						* Flash development
						* Mobile development
						* Team leadership
						* Project management
						* Creative technology
						* Creative direction
						* Client relations
						* Server administration
						* On-site installation
						* Trouble-shooting

						I have varying proficiency in the following tools and technologies:

						* HTML5/CSS
						* Markdown
						* Sass/Less
						* Jade/Slim
						* Gulp/Grunt
						* NodeJS
						* JavaScript/Coffeescript
						* AngularJS
						* Ruby
						* Padrino
						* PHP
						* Grunt
						* Flash/Actionscript
						* Native iOS Dev (Xcode)
						* Objective-C
						* Ubuntu
