						#I like to make cool things with computers and occasionally talk about myself in the third-person.
						
						You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city.
						
						It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.
						
						There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itself!
						
						Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
						
						But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding.
						
						You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.
